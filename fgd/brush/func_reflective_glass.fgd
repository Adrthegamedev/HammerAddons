Typically, you want your glass brush to have nodraw on all non-reflective surfaces and you want to use a shader like lightmappedreflective in your material applied to the non-nodraw surfaces. See hl2/materials/glass/reflectiveglass001.vmt for an example. NOTE: currently, you cannot use reflective glass in scenes with water, and you can only have 1 reflective glass in your view frustum ( + pvs ) at a time."
