Note that the health of the object will be overridden by the health inside the model, to ensure consistent health game-wide. If the model used by the prop is configured to be used as a prop_physics (i.e. it should be physically simulated) then it CANNOT be used as a prop_dynamic. Upon level load it will display a warning in the console and remove itself. Use a prop_physics instead."
